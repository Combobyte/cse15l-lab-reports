# Lab Report 2

---

Hello! Welcome to lab report 2! Today we will be talking about 3 code changes that we made to the markdown parser code during lab 3.

1. The first code change that we made:

    a. Here is an image of the fist code change commit:

    b. The file that caused this failure inducing input was [this one](https://github.com/Tyler-Culp/markdown-parser/blob/main/break-file.md)

    c. From the image above we can see that the symptom of a failure was the `java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    d. The relation between the bug, the symptom, and the failure inducing input was the input and the bug were the ones that caused the index to increase past the length of the string. This resulted in java throwing the symptom which was the `java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`
